# SQL Exploration Of World_Bank_Loan
This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the World Bank's loan data using SQL queries. The World Bank provides extensive financial information about its loans to various countries for diverse development projects.

With an ever-growing volume of financial data related to loans granted for diverse development projects across countries, there is a critical need to harness the power of SQL queries for systematic exploration and analysis.

The primary challenge is to design and implement SQL queries capable of extracting pertinent information from the dataset. These queries should cover a spectrum of analytical dimensions, including temporal trends, regional patterns, risk assessments, and comparative analyses among countries and sectors

## Tools Used
1. Pandas
2. MYSQL

## Objectives

## Approach
#### Data Import and Initial Exploration
In data analysis, the initial step of importing a dataset and exploring its initial content is akin to opening a door to valuable insights. This is essential because it allows us to ensure we have the right data foundation for uncovering key information and patterns in the context of our project.

#### Identifying Duplicate Data

In this step, we aim to identify and quantify the presence of 
duplicate data within our dataset. The count of duplicates 
(referred to as 'duplicates' in the code) is an important metric. It helps us understand the extent of redundancy in our dataset, which is crucial for data quality and accuracy in our analysis. By recognizing and handling duplicate records, we ensure that our insights and conclusions are based on unique, meaningful data, preventing any potential distortions caused by repeated entries.


#### Removing Duplicate Data
In this step, we are removing duplicate data from our dataset by utilizing the drop_duplicates function with the inplace=True parameter. Duplicate data can introduce noise and inaccuracies into our analysis, and removing them ensures that we work with unique and non-repetitive records. This process improves the quality and reliability of our data, setting the stage for more accurate and meaningful insights.


#### Identifying Missing Data¶
Here, we're examining our dataset for missing values, indicated by 'null' values. The 'null_values' variable holds the count of missing data points for each column. Identifying and quantifying missing data is crucial as it helps us understand the completeness of our dataset. Dealing with missing values appropriately is essential for accurate analysis and decision-making. By knowing the extent of missing data, we can take measures to handle them effectively and ensure the reliability of our results.



#### Handling Missing Data
In this step, we're addressing missing data in specific columns, namely 'Board Approval Date' and 'Effective Date (Most Recent).' We use the dropna function with the subset parameter to remove rows with missing values in these columns, setting inplace=True. Handling missing data is crucial to maintain data integrity and accuracy in our analysis. By removing rows with missing values in these specific columns, we ensure that the dataset remains reliable and complete for our subsequent analysis.


#### Data Preparation and Column Transformation
In this step, we are preparing the dataset for analysis. We remove unnecessary columns and rename some columns to improve clarity and consistency. This ensures that the dataset is optimized for our analysis, making it more concise and easier to work with in the next stages of our project.



#### Data Conversion and Export
In this step, we are converting date columns to the appropriate datetime format. This is essential for accurate date-based analysis. After the conversion, we export the cleaned dataset to a CSV file for future use and verify the data types to ensure they are in the correct format.



### Trend Analysis
Once we've prepared our data, we'll use sql to analyse any patterns within the data
#### Data Import and Database Connection
We'll start by loading sql libraries and connecting to the sql.
In order to load the data we'll have to use MySQLWorkbench. we'll first login into our Local instance. Once that is complete, we'll have to create a new schema to hold our new table. after the schema is created, use the table data import wizard to load the data into the csv. During the import, MYSQL Workbench will prompt the data type of each dataset. During this process, select the appropriate data types such as datetime , double , string to the needed attributes.

#### Creating the Database Connection
in the next step we create our database connection using the pymysql library


### Asking questions to uncover patterns
We start our analysis by asking questions relevant to the topic

#### Q1: How Many Countires in the world bank have loans


#### Q2: Calculating Total Loan Amount for Each Project
